# angel_vetjob

This is a Vet Job ive been working on for a while, people with the job 'vet' will be able to access the Vet Shop Menu (Shown with a blip on the Map). They can then Purchase Pet Bandages and Horse Stimulants for $5 each. ( This is fully Customisable in server/main.lua).

Please Note the Pet Bandages only work on Pets from any pet scripts. (I use Gum_Pets)

You can add new locations with blips in the Config.lua.

This Script is Dependant on VORP_CORE.

[If you wanted you could add a Vet Society with syn_society script for Job ranks, Hiring, Firing, Inventory and Salary.]
